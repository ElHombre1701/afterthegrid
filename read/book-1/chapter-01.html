<h2>PART ONE: 3:17 AM</h2>

<p>Alex Hartwell woke up screaming.</p>

<p>Not the nightmare kind where you jolt awake confused about which world is real. This was worse. This was every nerve in her skull suddenly on fire, like someone had shoved a fork into an electrical socket except the socket was her entire head.</p>

<p>She thrashed sideways out of bed, got tangled in her grandmother's quilt (the one with the sunflowers that looked cheerful in daylight and like dying things at 3 AM), and hit the floor hard enough to bruise her shoulder. Then she just lay there, breathing like she'd sprinted a marathon in her sleep.</p>

<p>Something was wrong with the world.</p>

<p>Not wrong like broken. Wrong like altered.</p>

<p>Her clock radio—the Sony that Thomas had given her for Christmas two years ago—was glowing. Not just the display. The whole thing seemed to pulse with this weird energy she could almost see, like heat shimmer off summer asphalt. Like the air around it was vibrating at a frequency that made her teeth itch.</p>

<p>The clock face showed <strong>3:17 AM</strong> in red LED numbers. The numbers themselves looked sick and wrong, pulsing like they were trying to communicate something. The radio's chrome casing caught light from somewhere—the streetlight outside?—and threw it back at her in waves.</p>

<p>That wasn't normal. Clock radios didn't do that.</p>

<p>Alex pulled herself up on the edge of her bed, trying to breathe through her nose like they taught in PE when you were about to puke from running too hard. The clock radio hummed at her. Not with sound, exactly. With something else. Something that bypassed her ears entirely and went straight into her skull.</p>

<p>The refrigerator downstairs was doing it too. Three floors away, through walls and insulation, and she could feel it like a pressure behind her eyes. Different from the clock. Deeper. Like a bass note she couldn't hear but could sense vibrating in her bones. The old Westinghouse unit—avocado-colored, probably installed in the early 1970s—was broadcasting something.</p>

<p><em>Okay</em>, she thought, using the voice she used during horror movies to keep herself from freaking out. <em>This is fine. This is totally normal. I'm just having some kind of seizure or something. People have seizures. It's a medical thing.</em></p>

<p>She looked at her hands. They were shaking. They looked like someone else's hands—someone scared, someone with good reasons to be scared—which meant they couldn't be her hands because Alex Hartwell was fine. Alex was great. Alex was just lying on her bedroom floor at three in the morning while her house hummed at her like a giant electric beehive.</p>

<h2>PART TWO: 6:00 AM (School Gets Closer)</h2>

<p>School started at 7:50 AM. Alex knew this because she'd been to Ramsay High School every day for two years, and the routine was as fixed as the laws of physics: wake up (allegedly), shower, eat breakfast while Dad read the newspaper, catch the bus at 7:30, arrive at school by 8:00 for first period.</p>

<p>Today was January 28th. Wednesday.</p>

<p>She made it through the shower by keeping her eyes closed and telling herself that the pipes weren't singing, that the water heater in the basement wasn't pulsing with that same weird rhythm as everything else. Hot water. Then cold water. Then that weird lukewarm moment when the tank was adjusting. All perfectly normal appliance behavior.</p>

<p>Breakfast was cereal. Her mother had passed out on the couch again (gin bottle on the coffee table, same as usual), so it was just her and Dad in the kitchen. Dad was reading the <em>Birmingham News</em>, folding it into quarters the way he always did, scanning the pages with an intensity that suggested he was looking for something specific. Some kind of code hidden in the classified ads or the weather report.</p>

<p>"You look tired," he said, not looking up from the paper.</p>

<p>That was technically true, though it also failed to capture the existential terror that had been gnawing at her since 3:17 AM.</p>

<p>The cereal was Lucky Charms. The milk was cold. The kitchen was warm from the oven (Dad had made toast), and the radio on top of the refrigerator—a Sony transistor model, cream-colored, from probably 1975—was playing something soft and synthesizer-heavy. Prince, maybe. Some 1980s pop thing that was occupying the early morning slot on WBRC-FM.</p>

<p>The marshmallows—little hearts and stars and moons, dyed in lurid colors that no natural food should be—seemed to float in the milk like tiny islands. She didn't usually pay attention to them, but they seemed especially vivid this morning. Especially present.</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>He turned the page with the precise, methodical care of someone performing a ritual. The newspaper crackled. The radio played. The refrigerator pressed against her awareness like a held breath.</p>

<p>It was 6:47 AM.</p>

<h2>PART THREE: 8:15 AM - 1:45 PM (School)</h2>

<p>Ramsay High School was a concrete bunker from the 1960s that looked like someone had tried to design a prison and accidentally added too many windows. The fluorescent lights buzzed. All of them. Every single tube in every single hallway, creating this constant high-pitched whine that made Alex feel like her brain was being slowly sanded down.</p>

<p>Which, in retrospect, might have been the point.</p>

<p>Hard to notice anything strange when the background misery is constant.</p>

<p>The tubes themselves—long rectangles of phosphorous and mercury vapor—threw off a sickly pale light that made everyone look like they were already dead. The hallways were painted institutional beige, with the occasional splash of school spirit posters (CRIMSON TIDE PRIDE in red letters, a drawing of an elephant that looked like it had been made by Picasso, age 4). Like someone had forgotten what enthusiasm looked like and just painted words on the wall hoping students would catch it.</p>

<p>Lockers lined the walls—metal, dented, covered in stickers and scratches. The smell of the hallways was a mix of industrial cleaner (that burning chemical smell that never quite went away), sweat, and something else. Adolescent desperation, maybe. Or the death of potential.</p>

<p>She made it through homeroom by gripping her desk until her knuckles went white. Mr. Stephens read attendance off a clipboard like he was performing a sacred ritual. Nobody was absent. Nobody was ever absent. You could be literally dying and Ramsay High would still want you to sit in a plastic chair for forty-five minutes while Mr. Stephens read your name in alphabetical order. The PA system—a speaker mounted in the corner, protected by a metal cage—crackled to life with some announcement about basketball tryouts. The voice came through tinny and distorted, but underneath the distortion was that <em>thing</em>. That pattern. That frequency-she-could-feel-but-not-hear pattern. Even the announcements were infected.</p>

<p>She made it through English (Period 2) by staring at <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> and not thinking about the way the intercom speaker above Mrs. Patterson's desk—cream-colored, round, with little holes for sound—was pulsing with that weird shimmer. Mrs. Patterson was discussing the moral implications of the trial, which was important, except also there was a weird frequency underneath everything and nobody else seemed to notice. She could have said something. Instead: "Um. The trial shows how society is complicated." Mrs. Patterson seemed satisfied with this insight about the fundamental complexity of human nature.</p>

<p>She made it through algebra (Period 3) by sitting in the back and pretending to focus on quadratic equations while the pencil sharpener on the windowsill—unplugged, broken, completely dead since sometime in 1984—glowed at her like it was trying to communicate something important about the breakdown of institutional equipment maintenance.</p>

<p>A dead pencil sharpener. Glowing. With no power source.</p>

<p><em>That's fine</em>, Alex told herself with the deadpan certainty of someone whose brain had already accepted that reality was broken. <em>That's totally normal. Unplugged things glow all the time. This is a completely ordinary Wednesday.</em></p>

<p>Except broken electrical devices definitely shouldn't glow.</p>

<p>By lunch—in the cafeteria that smelled like institutional potato and mystery meat, where students sat under more fluorescent lights and ate food off plastic trays—she'd developed a solid theory: either something had happened to her brain overnight (stroke, tumor, psychotic break, take your pick), or something had happened to reality itself and she was just the lucky girl who got to experience it.</p>

<p>Both options continued to suck.</p>

<p>The cafeteria's main serving line had a sneeze guard made of acrylic plastic, and behind it were the food warmers. Stainless steel containers with heat lamps, all of them glowing with that shimmer. The mystery meat—gray-brown substance of unknowable origin, served by lunch ladies in hairnets who seemed to have accepted their role in this institutional machine—was broadcasting something. Which raised the question: had the mystery meat been weird all along, or was the frequency making it weird? Were the lunch ladies complicit, or just tired? Did anyone care?</p>

<p>So when she found herself walking toward the photography darkroom in the basement—she was taking photography as an elective, one of the few classes that didn't make her want to claw her eyes out—she was already primed for weird stuff. Already mentally prepared for the universe to keep throwing curveballs.</p>

<p>The darkroom was in the basement level, down a concrete stairwell that smelled like old masonry and chemicals. The lights down here were different—less fluorescent, more incandescent. Warmer. Less designed to slowly erase your personality.</p>

<p>It was quiet. Not silent. But quieter than anywhere else in the school. The red safelights didn't buzz the way the fluorescents did—they just glowed a constant, warm red that made everything look like it was underwater. The room didn't shimmer and pulse like everywhere else. Just a steady two-tone hum. It was almost peaceful. Almost normal.</p>

<p>Almost like being allowed back inside herself.</p>

<h2>PART FOUR: 1:50 PM (Photography Documentation)</h2>

<p>"Document something that interests you," Mrs. Chen announced, handing her the Polaroid. "Use the school camera. Turn in results by Friday. Any subject—architecture, people, nature, whatever."</p>

<p>Alex picked up the camera. It was a battered Polaroid SX-70—the kind with the automatic focus and the built-in flash, probably donated in the late '70s—the kind of thing that looked like an artifact even in 1987. It felt warm in her hands. Not just body-heat warm, but warmer than it should be. Aware. Conscious.</p>

<p>Which was crazy.</p>

<p>But what if she could photograph what she was seeing?</p>

<p>The thought hit her like a punch.</p>

<p>What if the Polaroid didn't care whether she sounded insane?</p>

<p>What if it just showed her what was there? Fast film could freeze moments too quick for perception. Long exposures could show star trails invisible to the naked eye. What if the Polaroid—with its electronic flash and its ability to produce instant prints—could somehow see electromagnetic fields? Could somehow detect the thing that made her skull ache?</p>

<p>It was insane. You couldn't photograph invisible frequencies. You couldn't photograph the thing that made appliances glow. You couldn't photograph whatever this <em>was</em>.</p>

<p>Or could you? It was worth a shot.</p>

<p>The fluorescent light in the main hallway was just a light. Rectangular panel, institutional design, nothing special. Alex pointed the Polaroid at it and clicked the shutter.</p>

<p>There was a mechanical whirring sound as the film advanced. The print ejected from the camera's slot—a tangible, physical piece of evidence.</p>

<p>The image that developed over the next sixty seconds was wrong.</p>

<p>The light itself was fine—properly exposed, clear, exactly what you'd expect from a photograph of a fluorescent fixture. But around it, there was this… <em>distortion</em>. Like a halo. Like looking at a candle through heat shimmer, except this wasn't heat. This was something the Polaroid's lens had <em>seen</em> that shouldn't have been there.</p>

<p>The distortion looked almost like reality was slightly out of focus in that specific spot. Like the space around the light was vibrating at a frequency the camera could detect but human eyes mostly ignored.</p>

<p>Alex took another shot. Different angle. Same result: the fixture was normal, but something around it was warped. Bent. Like reality itself was slightly off-kilter.</p>

<p>She photographed three electrical outlets scattered throughout the school. All showed the same thing—clear image of the outlet, weird shimmer around the edges. A glow. A pulse captured on film.</p>

<p>She snuck out to the parking lot and found the big electrical junction box on the side of the building—the one mounted on the concrete wall, big gray metal container with warning stickers about high voltage. The one that had been making her teeth hurt all day just from standing near it.</p>

<p>The photograph came out looking almost broken. The distortion was so intense the Polaroid image seemed to vibrate even after it had fully developed, the colors bleeding slightly, the shimmer so pronounced it looked like the entire box was surrounded by invisible flames.</p>

<p>By 4:15, Alex had sixteen Polaroids stuffed in her backpack, each one showing something that shouldn't be possible. Each one proving she wasn't crazy.</p>

<p>Unless she was hallucinating the distortions in the photos as well.</p>

<p>Either way, she had evidence now.</p>

<h2>PART FIVE: 4:30 PM - 5:15 PM (Walking Home)</h2>

<p>The walk home was twelve blocks down Clairmont Avenue. Alex had done it a thousand times—down past the Winn-Dixie supermarket (with its bright fluorescent signs advertising weekly specials), through the neighborhood with the big oak trees that dropped acorns on the sidewalk every fall. Boring. Safe. Normal.</p>

<p>Not today.</p>

<p>Today the power lines were alive.</p>

<p>She could see them now, really see them, strung between utility poles like the world's ugliest Christmas lights. Each one glowing with that shimmer, that overexposed aura, pulsing in rhythms she could almost count. And they were all connected. She'd always known they were connected.</p>

<p>She just hadn't known they could notice her.</p>

<p>The transformers at the top of the poles were especially bright. Metal cylinders painted gray, containing oil and magnetic coils and all the machinery required to step down voltage from the distribution lines to neighborhood levels. Each one a node in a vast neural network.</p>

<p>A car drove past with its radio blaring. Top 40. Synth-pop and drum machines. Prince or maybe Duran Duran. But underneath the music—underneath it, like a watermark or a secret track—there was something else.</p>

<p>Alex stopped walking.</p>

<p>It wasn't the shimmer from the electrical stuff. This was different. Deliberate. Mathematical. Patient. Something that felt like it was trying to communicate something to anyone who could perceive it.</p>

<p>The car was already gone, but she could still feel it. That pulse. That hidden signal buried under Casey Kasem's countdown, broadcast through every radio in the city. Through every TV. Through the whole electromagnetic spectrum, probably, if she could figure out how to tune into it.</p>

<p>Her skull ached.</p>

<p>She started walking again. Faster now. Past houses where TVs flickered behind curtains—she could see the colors changing as channels switched, the glow of cathode ray tubes providing light and that pulse, that frequency—each one adding its own note to the chorus. Even the hip-hop had that pattern underneath it. That thing. That signal that someone or something was broadcasting to everyone, and no one seemed to care.</p>

<p>The streetlights came on (on automatic timers, probably triggered by light sensors) just as the sun touched the horizon. Each one flickering to life with a slight delay, sodium vapor lamps creating that yellow-orange glow that made everything look like it was underwater.</p>

<p>By the time she got home at 5:15 PM, Alex went straight to her room, pulled out the geometry textbook she'd hollowed out months ago for storing stuff she didn't want found, and hid the sixteen Polaroids inside, tucking them between the pages where no one would look.</p>

<p>Then she lay on her bed and tried not to think about what she'd felt out there.</p>

<p>She failed.</p>

<h2>PART SIX: 10:00 PM - 11:15 PM (Night Crisis)</h2>

<p>Sleep wasn't happening.</p>

<p>Alex had tried. Lights off at 10 PM, staring at the ceiling in darkness, waiting for her brain to shut down like brains were supposed to at night. But the moment the lights went off, everything got louder. Brighter. More intense. Like her bedroom had been waiting for darkness to really show off.</p>

<p>Her clock radio was practically singing now. Not with sound. With that other thing. That band-she-could-feel-but-not-hear thing. The radio's red LED numbers glowed in the darkness like eyes, and they pulsed in rhythm with something she couldn't name.</p>

<p>The alarm clock on her dresser (a smaller unit, battery-powered, backup system in case the power went out) was keeping rhythm with it. Her computer monitor—a Commodore with a green monochrome display, Dad had bought her the system last year, said she'd need it for college—was producing a high-pitched whine that sounded almost desperate, the electron beam scanning across the screen in predictable patterns even though the monitor should have been in sleep mode.</p>

<p>And underneath it all, that pattern from the radio. That mathematical thing. Pulsing through the house like a heartbeat. Like the house itself was alive.</p>

<p>By 11:00 PM, Alex did something stupid: she went outside.</p>

<p>She thought maybe distance would help. Fresh air. Space between her and the humming appliances. But standing on the front porch in her pajamas in late January Birmingham (it was cold, maybe 45 degrees, humid the way it always was) just made it worse, because now she could sense the whole neighborhood.</p>

<p>Power lines strung between poles, each one glowing with that shimmer. Streetlights pulsing in unison, sodium vapor creating that yellow-orange glow. The entire electrical grid spreading out through Birmingham like the nervous system of something impossibly huge.</p>

<p>And all of it was humming at her.</p>

<p>She was standing there, freezing, trying not to have a complete breakdown, when the black car pulled into the driveway.</p>

<h2>PART SEVEN: 11:15 PM - 11:38 PM (The Gray Suits)</h2>

<p>The car was a sedan. Early 1980s. A Buick or maybe a Chevrolet—dark colored, professional looking, the kind of car that looked like someone had asked Lee Iacocca to design a vehicle that would be forgotten five seconds after seeing it. Like it had been engineered to not be remembered.</p>

<p>Two people got out. Gray suits. In January. Walking with the kind of synchronized precision that suggested either military training or complete inability to understand how normal human bodies moved. Like they'd learned how people moved from something that had never been one.</p>

<p>They didn't look right.</p>

<p>Alex couldn't explain it better than that. Something about their faces was too smooth. Like they'd been drawn on. Their movements too synchronized—when they turned, they turned together, heads rotating at exactly the same speed. Their skin had a quality that wasn't quite human. Not quite alien either, just… wrong. Like they were wearing people-suits over something else, something that had studied human behavior from manuals and was doing its best but had missed some crucial detail.</p>

<p>They felt <span class="anomaly">wrong</span>. In the same way the appliances felt present—broadcasting, humming, alive—these people felt absent. Like holes in the shape of humans. Like looking at a place where a person should be, but the space was occupied by something that had learned to look like a person by carefully studying photographs.</p>

<p>Alex didn't decide to go inside. Her body just did it, some animal instinct screaming at her to get away. She slipped through the front door, closed it quietly (gently, carefully, trying not to make sound), and immediately felt like she'd made a mistake because now she was trapped inside with the humming appliances and couldn't see what the gray-suit people were doing.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang. Not a buzzer. An actual bell—ding-dong, mechanical, requiring someone to physically push a button and wait for a physical consequence.</p>

<p>She heard her father get up. Heard him coming downstairs, the familiar creak of the third step. Heard the front door open.</p>

<p>Alex crept to the top of the landing. She'd never been the eavesdropping type—that was more Thomas's thing when they were kids—but apparently today was full of firsts.</p>

<p>"Good evening," the voice was calm. Professional. And deeply, fundamentally <span class="anomaly">wrong</span>. Like they were reading from a script written by someone who'd never met a person. Every word exactly the same volume and pace. "We're with the U.S. Board of Education Wellness Assessment and Technical Compliance Headquarters."</p>

<p>Everything stopped.</p>

<p>Not metaphorically. The house actually went quiet. The appliances stopped humming. The pattern underneath reality went <em>silent</em>. For three full seconds, the world held its breath.</p>

<p>Then her father said, in a voice Alex had never heard him use before: "I don't know what you're talking about. It's late. Please leave."</p>

<p>He slammed the door in their weird faces!</p>

<p>The black car stayed in the driveway for exactly seventeen minutes. Alex counted every one of them, sitting at the top of the stairs with her heart slamming against her ribs. The gray-suit people didn't knock again. Didn't try to break in. Just sat there. Waiting. Like they had all the time in the world and this was just the opening move in a very long game. Like "seventeen minutes" was somehow meaningful to them.</p>

<p>At 11:38 PM, her father knocked softly on her bedroom door.</p>

<h2>PART EIGHT: 11:38 PM - 12:15 AM (The Conversation)</h2>

<p>"They call themselves the Wellness Assessment and Technical Compliance Headquarters," Robert said. He was sitting on the edge of Alex's bed in the darkness, and somehow he looked older than he had that morning. Tired in a way that went deeper than just needing sleep. "I don't know who they really are."</p>

<p>"That's… convenient," Alex said.</p>

<p>Her father didn't smile.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly. But people who can sense things—electromagnetic fields, frequencies most people can't perceive—those people become interesting to certain organizations. Valuable. Or dangerous."</p>

<p>He paused, then reached over and took her hand. His grip was warm and steady. "But here's what matters: you're not alone in this."</p>

<p>Her father was quiet for a long moment. In the darkness, Alex could feel her clock radio doing its thing, that pulse and shimmer that had been driving her crazy all day. But it seemed gentler now. Almost like it was trying not to bother her.</p>

<p>"Your grandfather could do this," Robert said finally, his voice soft but certain. "See things in the… in the energy around us. It runs in families. Sometimes it skips. Sometimes it waits. Skips generations sometimes, but it runs in families. Your father—my father—he could perceive things that other people couldn't. Electromagnetic patterns. Frequency disturbances."</p>

<p>He squeezed her hand gently. "And he was brilliant. He taught me that what you're feeling isn't madness. It's a gift."</p>

<p>"How did he…" Alex started.</p>

<p>"He learned to control it. Learned to understand what he was perceiving instead of just being overwhelmed by it. And he learned to be careful, because there are people who want what you have. People who would use you if they could."</p>

<p>He paused, then added quietly, "But he also learned that the fear goes away. That this thing—this gift—it becomes part of you. It becomes something you can work with."</p>

<p>Alex felt something loosen in her chest. Not the fear entirely, but the worst of it. The conviction that she was losing her mind.</p>

<p>"What do I do?" Alex asked.</p>

<p>"For now? You try to sleep. You try to adjust."</p>

<p>He paused, and there was warmth in his voice now. Pride, but also protection. "You're already doing that, aren't you? The Polaroids."</p>

<p>Alex felt her face go hot. "How did you—"</p>

<p>"Because it's what your grandfather did."</p>

<p>A smile in his voice now. "He documented things. Kept records. Tried to understand what he was perceiving by creating evidence that other people could examine. You're doing the same thing. That's smart."</p>

<p>He moved to sit beside her more fully, his arm around her shoulders. "Just make sure those photographs stay hidden somewhere safe. Be very careful who you trust."</p>

<p>"Then what happens?" Alex asked.</p>

<p>"Then you wait. And you learn. People like you—people who can see what you see—you find each other eventually. Or someone finds you."</p>

<p>He looked at her directly, his expression serious but not frightening. "And when that happens, you'll know."</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>"You knew this was going to happen."</p>

<p>It wasn't really a question.</p>

<p>"I hoped it wouldn't," Robert said quietly. "But yes. I knew it might. And I've been terrified about it, if I'm being honest. Not because it's bad—it's not. But because I know what comes next. I know there are people who'll want to find you."</p>

<p>He took both of her hands in his. "But I also know that you're strong enough for this. I've watched you your whole life. You're curious. You're careful. You categorize things. You think."</p>

<p>He stood up—moved with a deliberateness that suggested this conversation had meaning beyond just the words—and looked at her in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Your grandfather would be proud of you," Robert said. "I'm proud of you. And tomorrow, when you wake up, this will still feel impossible. But you're not going to be facing it alone."</p>

<p>He left the door open a crack as he exited, letting a thin line of hallway light spill into her room. A small gesture. A reassurance that she could reach out if she needed to.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>Alex lay in the darkness listening to her room hum and pulse around her. The clock radio. The alarm clock. The computer monitor. All of them doing their thing, broadcasting their presence on frequencies that shouldn't exist but apparently did.</p>

<p>She was fifteen years old. Yesterday, her biggest problems had been a history test on Friday and whether that ginger kid in third period was ever going to start using deodorant.</p>

<p>Now everything had changed.</p>

<p>But her father wasn't frightened. Her father was <em>proud</em> of her.</p>

<p>That changed something.</p>

<p><em>This is fine</em>, she told herself, and this time the voice felt less like armor and more like truth. <em>This is strange and scary and I don't understand it. But I'm not alone.</em></p>

<p>The appliances hummed their agreement.</p>

<p>Or maybe their sympathy.</p>

<p>She wasn't sure she could tell the difference yet.</p>

<p>But tomorrow, she decided, she would try to figure it out.</p>
